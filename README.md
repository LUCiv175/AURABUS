# 🚌 Aurabus

**Aurabus** is a university project designed to improve the public transport experience in the Trentino region, inspired by the existing *Trentino Trasporti* app.  
The goal is to provide richer, smarter information about bus activity — including live tracking, passenger load insights, and predictive analytics.

## 🧠 Development Methodology

The team follows an **agile workflow** inspired by **Git Flow**, with feature-based branches and mandatory code reviews.

### Branch Structure
main → stable and tested version

develop → active development branch

feature/* → new features

fix/* → bug fixes

hotfix/* → urgent fixes on main



All pull requests must be reviewed and linked to an issue.

---

## 👥 Collaboration Guidelines

- Each contributor works on a dedicated feature branch.  
- Merges occur only via Pull Requests.  
- Commit messages follow the convention `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, etc.  
- Issues are labeled as `feature`, `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `design`.
